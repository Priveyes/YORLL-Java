The YOrk Reinforcement Learning Library (YORLL) has been developed by the Reinforcement
Learning (RL) Research Group at the University of York, UK. Originally YORLL was created for use
by the members of the research group to be used as a common platform for experiments. It has
since been decided that others could benefit from this resource and common platform.

This is my fork of it.
